This is for testing purposes only.

To get an initial set of HTML and CSS, you have to open the Settings tab and enable the Automatic Page Generator

If you scroll down on the settings page, you should see the Automatic Page Generator button near the bottom. By clicking this button, you start the process of generating your content automatically.

Once you’ve clicked the button, you’ll be directed to the first step of the generation: The Content. You can keep this default content for now and make changes to it later. Let’s go ahead and click Continue to Layouts at the bottom of the page to continue.

Now, you pick your theme. This part requires a bit more thought because it’s easier to choose a theme now than to update your theme later. When you’ve looked at some of the options at the top of the page and found one that you love, click Publish to finish.

Once you click Publish, GitHub does all the work to direct visitors to username.github.io to view your new website. This can take up to 10 minutes. After some time has passed, you can open a new tab in your browser to go to your site!
